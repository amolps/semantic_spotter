# Semantic Spotter

## Project Overview

Semantic Spotter is an advanced text analysis tool designed to process and analyze insurance policy documents. Utilizing state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, it can read through extensive policy texts and provide insights or answers to specific queries. This tool leverages technologies such as PDF processing, text chunking, sentence embeddings, and Flask for web interfacing.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Reads and extracts text from insurance policy documents.
- **Text Chunking**: Splits large texts into manageable chunks for better processing.
- **Text Embeddings**: Generates embeddings for text chunks to capture semantic meanings.
- **Query Processing**: Analyzes user queries and finds the most relevant text chunk.
- **Web Interface**: Simple and user-friendly web interface for interacting with the tool.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Virtual Environment (recommended)
